# AWS S3 Integration Summary - Kidora Playschool Manager

## Overview
I've successfully integrated AWS S3 file upload functionality into your Kidora Playschool Manager application. The system now supports both S3 and local file storage with automatic fallback capabilities.

## ✅ What's Been Added

### 1. **New Dependencies**
- `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - AWS SDK for S3 operations
- `multer-s3` - Multer storage engine for S3

### 2. **New Configuration Files**
- `server/config/aws.js` - AWS configuration and validation utilities
- `server/config/s3.js` - S3-specific multer configuration
- `server/docs/S3_SETUP.md` - Complete S3 setup guide
- `server/scripts/test-s3.js` - S3 configuration test script

### 3. **Updated Files**
- `server/middleware/upload.js` - Enhanced to support both S3 and local storage
- `server/routes/students.js` - Updated to handle S3 URLs
- `server/routes/uploads.js` - Updated to handle S3 URLs
- `server/server.js` - Added S3 validation and better logging
- `server/package.json` - Added new dependencies and test script

## 🗂️ File Organization in S3

Files are automatically organized with the following structure:

```
kidora/
├── students/
│   ├── photos/                    # Student profile photos
│   └── documents/
│       ├── birth-certificates/    # Birth certificate documents
│       └── id-proofs/            # ID proof documents
├── gallery/
│   └── photos/                   # Gallery photos uploaded by teachers
├── branding/
│   └── logos/                    # School logos
└── profiles/                     # Profile images
```

## 🔧 How to Set Up S3

### Step 1: Environment Variables
Add these variables to your `server/.env` file:

```env
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET_NAME=kidora
```

### Step 2: Test the Configuration
Run the S3 test script:

```bash
cd server
npm run test-s3
```

### Step 3: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

You should see output like:
```
📁 File Upload Configuration:
☁️  AWS S3 configuration detected
✅ S3 setup validated successfully
📦 Bucket: kidora
🌍 Region: us-east-1
```

## 🔄 Automatic Fallback

The system automatically detects if S3 is configured:
- **S3 Configured**: Files uploaded to S3, URLs point to S3
- **S3 Not Configured**: Files stored locally, URLs point to local server

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Seamless Integration**
- No frontend changes required
- Automatic URL handling
- Backward compatibility maintained

### 2. **Smart File Organization**
- Organized folder structure in S3
- Unique file naming to prevent conflicts
- Metadata storage for each file

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Graceful fallback to local storage
- Comprehensive error logging
- Validation of S3 configuration

### 4. **Security**
- IAM policy templates provided
- Secure credential handling
- File type and size validation

## 🧪 Testing

### Test S3 Configuration
```bash
npm run test-s3
```

### Test File Upload
1. Start the server
2. Go to Students → Add New Student
3. Upload a photo, birth certificate, or ID proof
4. Check your S3 bucket for the uploaded files

### Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```

## 📋 Required AWS Setup

### 1. **IAM Policy**
Create a policy with these permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::kidora",
                "arn:aws:s3:::kidora/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### 2. **S3 Bucket Configuration**
- Bucket name: `kidora`
- Region: `us-east-1` (or your preferred region)
- CORS configuration for web access
- Optional: Public read access for file viewing

## 📁 File Types Supported

The system supports these file types:
- **Images**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
- **Documents**: .pdf, .doc, .docx

Maximum file size: **5MB per file**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"S3 bucket access failed"**
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Verify bucket exists
   - Confirm credentials are correct

2. **Files still stored locally**
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check server logs for S3 validation messages
   - Restart server after adding environment variables

3. **Upload errors**
   - Check file size (5MB limit)
   - Verify file type is supported
   - Check network connectivity to AWS

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit AWS credentials to version control**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive data**
3. **Regularly rotate access keys**
4. **Monitor S3 access logs**
5. **Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual activity**

## 💰 Cost Considerations

- **S3 Storage**: ~$0.023 per GB per month
- **Data Transfer**: Free for uploads, charged for downloads
- **Requests**: ~$0.0004 per 1,000 PUT requests

For a typical playschool with 100 students:
- Estimated monthly cost: $2-5 USD
- Much more reliable than local storage
- Automatic backups and redundancy

## 📞 Support

For detailed setup instructions, see: `server/docs/S3_SETUP.md`

To test your configuration: `npm run test-s3`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Set up your AWS credentials** in the environment variables
2. **Run the test script** to verify configuration
3. **Test file uploads** through the application
4. **Monitor S3 usage** through AWS Console
5. **Set up lifecycle policies** for cost optimization

**Note**: The application will work with or without S3 configuration. If S3 is not set up, it will automatically use local file storage as a fallback.
